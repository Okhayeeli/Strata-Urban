1. Authentication Functionalities
Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be when they access the app.

User Registration with Email Verification
Require email verification during registration to ensure the email is valid (e.g., send a verification link or OTP).
Prevent duplicate email addresses or usernames.
Secure Login
Support username/email and password-based login.
Hash passwords using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
Return a secure token (e.g., JWT) upon successful login for subsequent requests.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor (e.g., SMS OTP, email OTP, or authenticator app) during login.
Option to enable/disable MFA for users.
Password Management
Allow users to reset their password via email (send a reset link or OTP).
Enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
Allow users to change their password from their profile.
Session Management
Implement session timeouts (e.g., tokens expire after a set period).
Allow users to log out and invalidate their session/token.
Support refresh tokens to extend user sessions without re-authentication.
Account Lockout
Lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
Notify users of suspicious login attempts.
OAuth/Social Login
Allow users to log in using third-party providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) for convenience.
Map third-party user data to your app’s user model.
API Key Authentication for Providers
Allow Providers to generate API keys for integrating with your app programmatically (e.g., for automated booking management).
Device Management
Track devices used for login (e.g., show a list of active devices).
Allow users to log out from specific devices remotely.
2. Authorization Functionalities
Authorization ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions they are permitted to.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Define roles (e.g., CLIENT, PROVIDER, ADMIN) in the EnumRoles field of the User class.
Restrict endpoints based on roles (e.g., only Providers can access /api/bookings/provider/{providerId}).
Allow Admins to manage all users, bookings, and providers.
Permission-Based Access Control
Define granular permissions (e.g., CREATE_BOOKING, CONFIRM_BOOKING, VIEW_PROVIDER_DASHBOARD).
Map permissions to roles (e.g., Clients can create bookings, Providers can confirm bookings).
Resource Ownership
Ensure users can only access their own resources (e.g., a Client can only see their own bookings, a Provider can only see their own vehicles).
Validate ownership during API requests (e.g., check if userId matches the clientId in /api/bookings/client/{clientId}).
Provider-Specific Access
Restrict Providers to manage only their own bookings, vehicles, and drivers.
Prevent Providers from accessing other Providers’ data (e.g., bookings, dashboard stats).
Booking Status-Based Access
Restrict actions based on booking status (e.g., a Client can’t cancel a booking that’s already in progress).
Allow Providers to confirm or assign drivers only for PENDING bookings.
Admin Privileges
Allow Admins to view and manage all users, providers, bookings, and trips.
Provide endpoints for Admins to suspend or ban users/Providers.
Rate Limiting
Limit the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user).
Apply stricter limits for unauthenticated requests.
Data Visibility Control
Hide sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, email addresses) in API responses.
Expose only necessary data to Clients (e.g., don’t show Provider’s internal notes).
Audit Logging
Log all critical actions (e.g., login, booking creation, status updates) with timestamps and user IDs.
Allow Admins to view audit logs for troubleshooting or monitoring.
Secure File Uploads
Validate and sanitize file uploads (e.g., Provider documents) to prevent malicious files.
Restrict file types and sizes (e.g., only PDFs for documents, max 5MB).
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Configure CORS to allow requests only from trusted domains (e.g., your app’s frontend).
Prevent unauthorized domains from accessing your API.
Token Validation
Validate JWT tokens on every request to ensure they are not tampered with or expired.
Blacklist revoked tokens (e.g., after logout).
Secure Communication
Enforce HTTPS for all API requests to encrypt data in transit.
Use secure headers (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options) to prevent attacks like clickjacking.
Driver Access Control
If drivers have accounts, restrict them to view only their assigned trips.
Prevent drivers from modifying booking details (e.g., they can only start/end trips).
Geolocation Security
Secure real-time tracking data (e.g., in /api/trips/{id}/track) to prevent unauthorized access.
Limit tracking access to the Client and Provider involved in the trip.
3. Additional Security Features
These are broader security measures to protect the app and its users.

Input Validation and Sanitization
Validate all user inputs (e.g., email format, phone numbers) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Sanitize inputs to remove malicious code.
Data Encryption
Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., passwords, payment information) using strong encryption (e.g., AES-256).
Use environment variables to store sensitive keys (e.g., JWT secret, database credentials).
Payment Security
If the app handles payments, integrate with a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
Comply with PCI DSS standards for handling payment data.
Avoid storing sensitive payment information (e.g., credit card numbers).
Third-Party Integrations
Secure API keys for third-party services (e.g., Google Maps for tracking, Twilio for SMS).
Rotate API keys regularly and store them securely.
Security Monitoring
Monitor for suspicious activity (e.g., multiple failed logins, unusual API usage).
Set up alerts for potential security breaches.
GDPR/CCPA Compliance
Allow users to delete their accounts and data (right to be forgotten).
Provide a privacy policy and obtain user consent for data collection.
Allow users to export their data (e.g., bookings, trips).
IP Whitelisting
Allow Admins to restrict access to certain endpoints (e.g., admin APIs) to specific IP addresses.
This list covers the major security functionalities you’ll need to consider for your e-hailing app. You can implement these gradually as your app grows, starting with the basics (e.g., secure login, RBAC) and adding more advanced features (e.g., MFA, audit logging) later.


In the response for Booking Request, let it fetch the client details too
